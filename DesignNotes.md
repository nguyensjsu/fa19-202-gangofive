## Design Notes
The following design patterns were implemented :
1)Observer : The observer pattern was implemented for acheving multiple functionalities.  

Here SnakeHead is the publisher and MyWorld is the listener. Everytime the snake eats a food object, SnakeHead notifies MyWorld about this event so MyWorld can do the required operations.

Here LevelController is the publisher and MyWorld is the listener. Every level has certain parameters based on which the certain game elements are added or removed. The change is level is based on the number of food objects consumed by the snake. Everytime the level changes LevelController notifies the MyWorld.

Here Scorecard is the publisher and LevelController is the listener. A level changes when the snake consumes 7 food objects. Scorecard keeps a track of number of food objects consumed by the snake and notifies LevelController.

2)State : State pattern is used to implement the different levels of the game. Every level has certain parameters based on which the certain game elements are added or removed.

3)Stratergy : In the game the user has an option to choose between three cities. The food objects change based on the city selected. This has been implemented using stratergy pattern.

4)Factory : Factory pattern is used to create different types of food, obstacles and powerup objects.

5)Decorator : Decorator pattern has been used to center align the text in the leaderboard screen.
